# How to Tune Your Clutch for Better Performance
 
If you are a serious racer or just want to get more performance out of your snowmobile, you need to know how to tune your clutch. The clutch is the vital link between the engine and the transmission, and it determines how efficiently the power is transferred to the track. A well-tuned clutch can make a big difference in your speed, acceleration, and belt life.

But how do you tune your clutch? What are the variables that affect its performance and efficiency? And what tools and procedures do you need to test and adjust your clutch?
 
In this article, we will answer these questions and more, based on the Clutch Tuning Handbook by Olav Aaen, a renowned expert and manufacturer of high-performance snowmobile products. Aaen's handbook is a comprehensive guide to the theory and practice of clutch tuning, covering various models of clutches and their components. You can download the full version of his handbook from Scribd[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], or read on for a summary of the main points.
 
## What is a clutch and how does it work?
 
A clutch is a device that allows the engine to vary its speed while keeping a constant load on the transmission. It consists of two main parts: the primary clutch (or drive clutch) and the secondary clutch (or driven clutch). The primary clutch is attached to the engine crankshaft, while the secondary clutch is attached to the jackshaft that drives the track. A V-belt connects the two clutches, transmitting the torque from the engine to the track.
 
The primary clutch is a centrifugal clutch that uses flyweights to apply pressure on a movable sheave (or half-pulley) that squeezes the belt. As the engine speed increases, the flyweights move outward due to centrifugal force, pushing the movable sheave closer to the fixed sheave. This reduces the diameter of the pulley and increases the belt speed. The secondary clutch is a torque-sensing clutch that uses springs and cams to control the position of a movable sheave that also squeezes the belt. As the torque increases, the springs compress and allow the movable sheave to move away from the fixed sheave. This increases the diameter of the pulley and reduces the belt speed.
 
The combination of these two clutches creates a variable speed transmission that can adjust to different load conditions and terrain. The goal of clutch tuning is to optimize this transmission for maximum performance and efficiency.
 
## What are the variables that affect clutch performance?
 
There are many variables that affect how a clutch performs, but they can be grouped into three main categories: engine characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and clutch components.
 
- Engine characteristics include power output, torque curve, peak rpm, fuel delivery system, exhaust system, etc. These factors determine how much power and torque the engine can produce at different speeds, and how responsive it is to throttle changes.
- Vehicle characteristics include weight, track length, track lug height, gearing ratio, suspension setup, etc. These factors determine how much load and resistance the vehicle faces on different terrain, and how well it can transfer power to the ground.
- Clutch components include flyweights, springs, cams, rollers, bushings, belts, etc. These factors determine how the clutches respond to engine speed and torque changes, and how they adjust their pulley diameters and belt speed.

All these variables interact with each other in complex ways, and they can vary depending on external conditions such as temperature, altitude, humidity, snow condition, etc. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for clutch tuning. You need to test and adjust your clutch according to your specific engine, vehicle, and riding style.
 
## What tools and procedures do you need to tune your clutch?
 
To tune your clutch effectively, you need some basic tools and a systematic testing procedure. Here are some of the essential tools you need:

- A tachometer: This is a device that measures engine speed in revolutions per minute (rpm). You need this to monitor your engine's performance and find its optimal operating range.
- A stopwatch: This is a device that measures time in seconds or fractions of seconds. You need this to measure your acceleration time from 0 to 60 mph or any other speed range 0f148eb4a0
